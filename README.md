## What is Ember?

This project started as an idea for the [Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/lisbon/web-development-course/full-time#curriculum) final challenge.

The [initial project](https://github.com/dc-lewagon/Ember) was developed by these coding wizards:
* [David Carmo](https://github.com/dmcarmo)
* [David Wylie](https://github.com/7thwave42)
* [Isaline W](https://github.com/isaline-w)
* [Sylvia Grill](https://github.com/SilviaG8)

All changes after the bootcamp were implemented by both David's.
    
### How it was built?
This project uses Ruby on Rails (using [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates) - created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team), Bootstrap and some Javascript magic.
